## Hi, I am Manasa Bellamkonda! Great to see you hereðŸ‘‹

I am Manasa Bellamkonda, a graduate student at University of Southern California in Computer Science. I have pursued Bachelors of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer Engineering from Pune Institute of Computer Technology. I love working on innovative ideas and pioneering technologies. I have previously worked at Platform9 Systems as 'Associate Member of Technical Staff' where I got the opportunity to work with cloud native technologies. I got a chance to develop scale testing scripts, perform scale testing and resolving issues at scale of around 500 nodes per kubernetes cluster. Additionally I worked with key kubernetes cluster components, ETCD, kubernetes networking solutions like Calico & Flannel, and cluster-addons like Metallb, Prometheus Monitoring, Grafana, Metrics Server.
